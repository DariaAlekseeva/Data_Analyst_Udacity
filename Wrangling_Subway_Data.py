def num_rainy_days(filename):
    '''
    This function should run a SQL query on a dataframe of
    weather data.  The SQL query should return one column and
    one row - a count of the number of days in the dataframe where
    the rain column is equal to 1 (i.e., the number of days it
    rained).  The dataframe will be titled 'weather_data'. You'll
    need to provide the SQL query.  You might find SQL's count function
    useful for this exercise.  You can read more about it here:
    
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/counting-rows.html
    
    You might also find that interpreting numbers as integers or floats may not
    work initially.  In order to get around this issue, it may be equal to cast
    these numbers as integers.  This can be done by writing cast(column as integer).
    So for example, if we wanted to cast the maxtempi column as an integer, we would actually
    write something like where cast(maxtempi as integer) = 76, as opposed to simply 
    where maxtempi = 76.

def max_temp_aggregate_by_fog(filename):

    for both foggy and non-foggy days).  The dataframe will be 
    titled 'weather_data'. You'll need to provide the SQL query.

def avg_min_temperature(filename):

    weather data.  The SQL query should return one column and
    one row - the average meantempi on days that are a Saturday
    or Sunday (i.e., the the average mean temperature on weekends).
    The dataframe will be titled 'weather_data' and you can access
    the date in the dataframe via the 'date' column.

    Also, you can convert dates to days of the week via the 'strftime' keyword in SQL.
    For example, cast (strftime('%w', date) as integer) will return 0 if the date
    is a Sunday or 6 if the date is a Saturday.
