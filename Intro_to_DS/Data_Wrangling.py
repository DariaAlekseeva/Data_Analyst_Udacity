    Given an input variable time that represents time in the format of:
    00:00:00 (hour:minutes:seconds)
    
    Write a function to extract the hour part from the input variable time
    and return it as an integer. For example:
        1) if hour is 00, your code should return 0
        2) if hour is 01, your code should return 1
        3) if hour is 21, your code should return 21
        
    Please return hour as an integer.

def reformat_subway_dates(date):
    '''
    The dates in our subway data are formatted in the format month-day-year.
    The dates in our weather underground data are formatted year-month-day.
    
    In order to join these two data sets together, we'll want the dates formatted
    the same way.  Write a function that takes as its input a date in the MTA Subway
    data format, and returns a date in the weather underground format.
    
    Hint: 
    There is a useful function in the datetime library called strptime. 
    More info can be seen here:
    http://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime
    '''
    #print date
    f = "%m-%d-%y"
    date_formatted = datetime.datetime.strptime(date, f)
    return date_formatted.date()
